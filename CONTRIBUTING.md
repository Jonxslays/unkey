## Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to `unkey_sdk`. It's people like you that make it such a great tool.

Please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

**Note**: Please get your contributions approved by the maintainers of [unkey_sdk](https://github.com/jonxslays/unkey_sdk) or the official [unkey](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/) maintainers before you start working on them. This will help avoid any conflicts and also help you understand if the contribution is in line with the project goals. You can do this by opening an issue with appropriate label and describing your contribution in detail.

### You have found a bug

Please open an issue with the label `bug`. To clearly explain the bug, describe it in as much detail as possible. Please add the steps to reproduce as well.

### You are requesting a new feature

Please open an issue with the label `enhancement` and include as much information as you can about the need for the feature. The maintainers will convert it into a discussion if needed.

### You want to add a new feature
