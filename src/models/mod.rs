//! This module houses the types you will be dealing with when sending and
//! receiving requests from unkey.
//!
//! Mostly you will be constructing the structs suffixed with `Request`, and
//! receiving the structs suffixed with `Response`. With some minor exceptions
//! like [`Wrapped`] and [`UndefinedOr`].
